# **My Project Plan** 
##  Note: This document is written by merely as an illustative example, amd does not provide any working guide to an actual project.
### Proposal
---
I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images. 
In order to build it, I will use opencv deep learning libraries, such as[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ko) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and other open source soft wares.

For example, the objects in the following images were detected using[mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection):
